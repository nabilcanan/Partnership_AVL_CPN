Please write a program that will take a list of parts from a BOM and help identify where there are multiple Mfg’s
approved for a customer PN (CPN).

The program will need to:
Concatenate the CPN and the Mfg PN
Then remove duplicates from that column
Then do a count of CPN’s
In that column then, anything with a count of 1 s/be changed to N and anything greater than 1 s/be changed to a Y.

See attached example.
Files might look different each time but each will include a column called CPN and then
variations of the Mfg PN column.
If needed we can make it a rule for the people who will run this that the columns that are being concatenated
are called something specific.
If you don’t know how to concatenate, col Q has the formula.

Please let me know how long this will take to complete.
Going forward until your last day, any projects assigned should only be worked on between 8am and 5pm, Mon – Fri.

Let me know if there are any questions.

Thanks,
Erin
